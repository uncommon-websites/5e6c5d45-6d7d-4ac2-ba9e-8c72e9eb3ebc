    "prompt": "A small RevOps team of two to three professionals in their late 20s to early 40s collaborates in a thoughtfully organized, modern office workspace. The environment features warm natural light, soft shadows, and subtle plum and amber accents in furniture or office accessories. The team is engaged in purposeful discussion or reviewing analog materials like notebooks and documents, with relaxed yet focused body language. The workspace is tidy, with clean desks, natural wood tones, soft textiles, and some greenery, evoking a sense of orchestrated clarity and productive calm. The composition is mid-distance, with generous negative space, clean lines, and an overall warm, sophisticated, and approachable mood. No screens, no digital tech, no text, no posters, no abstract elements—only real people and tangible objects in a credible, lived-in office setting.",
